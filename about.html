                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Head of Department for Government and Politics at an Ofsted Outstanding secondary school in Nottinghamshire following my teacher training at the University of Cambridge. I specialise both A level Geography and A level Politics with students under my auspices achieving in their final A level grade results significantly higher than the national average (approximately 9% in the last academic year). I work part time to allow me a few tutoring clients a year, to whom I offer a bespoke service.</p>

                <h3>My Teaching Experience</h3>
                <p>I have been teaching both A level Geography and Politics for 6 years in a secondary school setting and have been taking on 1-2 private tutees a year for the last 5 years. I have undertaken all available training to improve teaching methodology and follow curriculum development closely. I have tutoring experience in both AQA and Edexcel exam boards for both courses, I would recommend a different tutor if your exam board is OCR or anything else. Finally, I have experience helping students with Oxbridge preparations which I can also offer as a service.</p>

                <h3>My Teaching Approach</h3>
                <p>I specialise in refining and improving exam technique for students looking to achieve B-A* grades, though also teach course content where necessary as this is a vital starting point for producing high quality exam answers. I work closely with parents to ensure the best outcomes for students and aim to create a program of study which complements that undertaken by the tutee at school to maximise knowledge retention.</p>
